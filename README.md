# Practical-Machine-Learning

The link to the repo where I posted my .Rmd and html files is : https://github.com/ivalette/Practical-Machine-Learning
However, the size of the html seemed too big for previews in GitHub. 
Please go to this link to view html in ivalette.github.io in GitHuh: http://ivalette.github.io/ProjectPML.html
The page took about 30 seconds to load properly in my browser so be a little patient.

I also posted a word and pdf version of the peer assignment there. It contains the same information as my html. Use this if you have difficulties viewing the html with your browser.

Best regards,
Isabelle Valette
