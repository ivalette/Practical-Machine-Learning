# Practical-Machine-Learning

The link to the repo where I posted my .Rmd and html files is : https://github.com/ivalette/Practical-Machine-Learning
However, the size of the html seemed to big for simple previews. 
Please go to this link to view html in ivalette.github.io in GitHuh: http://ivalette.github.io/ProjectPML.html

I also posted a word version of the peer assignment there. It contains the same information as my html.

Best regards,
Isabelle Valette
